## Project

My client is a traveler and requests for a weather app, so that he can prepare for 
trips from one location to another.

The criteria for my traveling clients request folliow as:

* When city name is searched; current/future weather conditions are displayed and the city 
is saved to search history

* Searched city will present the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index(will show which conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe based on color)

* Future weather conditions are represented 5-days in advance

* Cities in the search history are abled to display forecast when clicked 

## Description

To meet my clients requests, I have executed the following actions:

* With a combination of JQuery and JavaScript file; the app will have the proper functionality to perform
actions such as:
  * Fetching/retrieving data to display for searched city
  * Save city in search history; when city in search history is clicked, weather forecast is displayed 
  * Display 5 day weather forecast for searched city
  
 * Integrated bootstrap elements for styling and layout designs in the index.html file; with minor direct CSS 
 styling
 
 * CSS to stlye general elements such as the body, text, and color to represent weather severity conditions
